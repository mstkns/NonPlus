# NonPlus

A verbose, high-level programming language for numerical computation.

## Key features
   - Currently none :(

## Progress
   - [x] Set up repo and first files
   - [ ] Create a basic lexer

Initial compiler is written in C, because I suck at C and need to get better.
For now, restrict to lexing string and integer literals.

In the long term, aim to make language self-hosting.
For that, the language will preferably need to support:
   - Basic logical operators
   - Variables and scoping
   - Integers and strings
   - `if`/`else`/`case` statements
   - `for`/`while` loops
   - Functions/procedures
   - Basic I/O
   - Some kind of memory management
   - Modularity; ability to split implementation across files
